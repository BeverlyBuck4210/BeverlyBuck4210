## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! Iâ€™m a React developer focused on building server-side rendered (SSR) applications using Next.js and TypeScript. This repository showcases a collection of my projects, where I emphasize performance optimizations, routing strategies, and type-safe development to create fast, scalable, and maintainable web applications.

One of the core strengths of my projects is the use of Next.js for SSR and static site generation (SSG). By leveraging Next.jsâ€™s hybrid rendering capabilities, I deliver applications that load faster and provide better SEO compared to traditional client-side apps. I make full use of features like getServerSideProps, getStaticProps, and incremental static regeneration to balance performance and dynamic data requirements.

Routing strategies play a critical role in building seamless user experiences. I implement both file-based routing and dynamic routing with clear structure and organization, making it easy to scale large applications. I also work with API routes in Next.js to build lightweight backend services and data endpoints within the same projectâ€”keeping things efficient and tightly integrated.

Using TypeScript, I ensure a strong layer of type safety across the entire codebase. Type definitions help catch bugs early, improve code clarity, and enhance the developer experience, especially when working in larger or collaborative teams. I also use tools like Zod or TypeScript interfaces to validate API responses and maintain consistency across front-end and back-end boundaries.

Feel free to explore, fork, or contribute to the projects in this repo. Whether you're interested in performance tuning, scalable architecture, or best practices in React development, I hope you find something useful here. Thanks for checking out my work!
